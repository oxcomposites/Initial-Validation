# Initial-Validation
The first test to ensure proper understanding of the manufacturing process of the wet layup. A 3 layer layup was attempted of a basic flat wing from a PETG 3D printed mould.

# Steps
1. Print: 15% infill PETG with small amount of sanding.
2. Release Agent: PVA release agent applied. It was over-applied and due to timings was left for 1 week.
3. Wet layup: 10g of resin for 3g of hardnener was used, it was mixed too roughly introducing air bubbles, a kitchen scales was used with limited accuracy. The carbon fiber was far more prone to fraying and imperfection than anticipated and requires the utmost delicacey and possible adhesive spray. The fibres cut far easier than anticipated.
4. Initial cure:
