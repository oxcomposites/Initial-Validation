# Initial-Validation
The first test to ensure proper understanding of the manufacturing process of the wet layup. A 3 layer layup was attempted of a basic flat wing from a PETG 3D printed mould.

# Steps
1. Print: 15% infill PETG with small amount of sanding.
2. Release Agent: PVA release agent applied. It was over-applied and due to timings was left for 1 week.
3. Wet layup: 10g of resin for 3g of hardnener was used, it was mixed too roughly introducing air bubbles, a kitchen scales was used with limited accuracy. The carbon fiber was far more prone to fraying and imperfection than anticipated and requires the utmost delicacey and possible adhesive spray. The fibres cut far easier than anticipated.
4. Initial cure: Left for approximately 18 hours in my boiler room (quite a damp and cool environment) and was tacky so moved into my living room for final curing.

# Safety
1. A respirator and googles worn throughout.
2. Latex gloves worn from start to end of cleanup.
3. All initial curing done away from living space.

These provisions are not strictly necessary (except the gloves) for the XCR Resin system as it has almost no fumes, however, given it is a shared living space and the risks are not fully understood a stringent approach was used.


# Improvements Needed
1. Better workspace for layup, a flat large surface required due to fraying of the sheet.
2. Sealed box to allow curing in living space.
3. Disposal: Need to dispose of items in a more organised manner throughout the process in a specific bag or equivalent.
